Installing Pre-Requisites
	* Download Python 3.7 from https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0-amd64.exe
	* Install and add Python to your PATH (This should be in the Installer)
		- If this didn't work, you can manually add Python to your PATH via these steps - https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/
	* Open a Command Prompt in the directory with the python file
		- Do this by going to the directory in the File Explorer
		- Click on the address bar (or press Alt + D)
		- Type in cmd into the address bar
		- In the pop-up window, run this command "pip install -r requirements.txt"

How to Run:
	* Place the Excel File (Proposal Workbook) into the directory
	* Run the Python File
		- Open the command prompt in the same way as earlier and run python main.py
		- Right Click on the File and Open With Python 3.7
	* The output will be in a Word Document with the same name as the Proposal File

Notes:
	* If you want to store the image folder (the tmp folder) rename it and move it outside the projectFolder
	* Ensure only one Excel File is in the directory at all times
	* Try not to interfere with the opened window while the program is running
